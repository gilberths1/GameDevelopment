# GameDevelopment
This is a project of my GameDev subject
On this project, i made a replica Fruit Ninja game called "Destroy The Ball". This project was inspired by a video on youtube on this link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g5_8sE18tQ&t=2913s. I changed all the fruit designs with new ball designs. I also added some features to the project, scoring system, random ball spawner, and main menus.
